Next.js and Serverless Backend Repository
This repository contains the code for a full-stack application built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Serverless framework on AWS.

Project Structure
The repository is organized into two main folders:

front-end: This folder contains the Next.js application which serves as the front-end of the application. It is built using Next.js for server-side rendering, Tailwind CSS for styling, and App Router for navigation.

back-end: In this folder, you'll find the Serverless backend for the application. It's powered by the Serverless framework and deployed on AWS. This backend handles the business logic, API endpoints, and interacts with various AWS services.
